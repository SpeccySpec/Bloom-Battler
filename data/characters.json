He was dosed with some suspicious medicine, but didn't feel anything, so he went to bed. The next morning, however, he felt different. He had horns on his head and he had gained the ability to breathe fire (He always had the pyrokinesis abilities since he was a lizard dw about that). He had been turned into a dragon. His first reaction was to find a way to get back into his older form, but he hasn't been able to do so. He has gotten used to this new form, however he does still look for ways to get back to his older form.",

Sparky's trip was going fine, until the space ship started going out of his control and went crazy, and ended up crashing on the planet called Yaretza.
